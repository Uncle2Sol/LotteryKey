# LotteryKey比特币私钥碰撞器
LotteryKey 是一款BTC 私钥碰撞器，其中LotteryKey代码系原创作品，分Python和html两个版本，功能类似，有条件的建议用Python版本，更快，占用资源更小，KeyZero中文版项目优化与汉化源自于英文版（https://github.com/vlnahp/KeyZero），在KeyZero的基础上进行了 Python3 的适配支持，已经一些所需兼容依赖关系库的更新。再次申明，私钥碰撞仅限娱乐和学习私钥wif和钱包地址的关系，碰撞成功的可能性几乎为零，比中彩票的概率还要低的多，本项目继承于KeyZero理念与精神。

# LotteryKey Bitcoin Private Key Collider
LotteryKey is a BTC private key collider. The LotteryKey code is an original work, available in both Python and HTML versions with similar functionality. The Python version is recommended for its speed and lower resource consumption. The Chinese version of the KeyZero project is an optimization and localization of the English version (https://github.com/vlnahp/KeyZero), adapted for Python 3 and updated with necessary compatibility dependencies. It should be reiterated that private key collision is for entertainment and learning purposes only, focusing on the relationship between private key Wi-Fi and wallet addresses. The probability of a successful collision is virtually zero, much lower than winning the lottery. This project inherits the philosophy and spirit of KeyZero.
