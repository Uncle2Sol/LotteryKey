# LotteryKey比特币私钥碰撞器
LotteryKey是一款BTC 私钥碰撞器，顾名思义，想要破解私钥钱包比中彩票的几率还要低，其中LotteryKey代码系原创作品，分Python和html两个版本，功能类似，有条件的建议用Python版本，更快，占用资源更小。
KeyZero中文版项目优化与汉化源自于英文版（https://github.com/vlnahp/KeyZero），在KeyZero的基础上进行了 Python3 的适配支持，以及一些所需兼容依赖关系库的更新。再次申明，私钥碰撞仅限娱乐和学习私钥和钱包地址的关系，碰撞成功的可能性几乎为零，比中彩票的概率还要低的多，本项目继承于KeyZero理念与精神。

如果作者在使用当中真的碰撞到有余额的私钥（概率极低），如果确定为沉睡钱包的话，将会对地址进行公示1个月，如果在一个月内，依然无人认领，或者余额没有转出的话，将会把所有余额转入如下BTC钱包地址：1BTv1Qhs1n7UExUpdxFPQQKNxrjLxAsicE ，因私钥碰撞涉及到道德和法律问题，转入该钱包的BTC将会作为公益性捐助钱包，用来帮助有需要的人或者组织。

特别提示：老式的非压缩私钥和钱包地址，使用交易所的Web3钱包导入可能显示的地址不一致，这个不是生成的有误，而是很多钱包不支持非压缩格式，推荐使用：Electrum钱包进行导入操作，即可显示正确的非压缩钱包地址，非压缩钱包地址的私钥第一位是 5 开头，压缩钱包私钥以K和L开头。



# LotteryKey Bitcoin Private Key Collider
LotteryKey is a BTC private key collider. As the name implies, the chance of cracking a private key wallet is even lower than winning the lottery. The LotteryKey code is an original work, available in two versions: Python and HTML, with similar functionality. If conditions allow, the Python version is recommended, as it is faster and consumes fewer resources.The optimization and Chinese localization of the KeyZero Chinese version project are derived from the English version (https://github.com/vlnahp/KeyZero). Based on KeyZero, it has been adapted to support Python 3, along with updates to some required compatible dependency libraries. It is reiterated that private key collision is solely for entertainment and learning the relationship between private keys and wallet addresses. The probability of a successful collision is almost zero, far lower than the probability of winning the lottery. This project inherits the philosophy and spirit of KeyZero.If the author truly collides with a private key that has a balance during use (an extremely low probability), and if it is determined to be a dormant wallet, the address will be publicly announced for 1 month. If no one claims it within one month, or if the balance is not transferred out, all the balance will be transferred to the following BTC wallet address: 1BTv1Qhs1n7UExUpdxFPQQKNxrjLxAsicE. Because private key collision involves ethical and legal issues, the BTC transferred to this wallet will serve as a charitable donation wallet to help people or organizations in need.Special Note: For old-style uncompressed private keys and wallet addresses, importing them into exchange Web3 wallets may display inconsistent addresses. This is not an error in generation, but rather that many wallets do not support the uncompressed format. It is recommended to use the Electrum wallet for import operations, which will display the correct uncompressed wallet address. Uncompressed wallet private keys start with 5, while compressed wallet private keys start with K or L.
